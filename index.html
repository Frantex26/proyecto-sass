                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p><strong>Dark Souls trilogy is an action role-playing video game</strong>. Developed by FromSoftware and distributed by
                    Namco Bandai Games. Dark Souls trilogy is a series of games that covers Dark Souls, Dark Souls II
                    and
                    Dark Souls III. Its a third-person action role-playing game. One of the core mechanic of the game is
                    exploration. Players are encouraged to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find
                    alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous, interconnected
                    environment, connected through a central hub area. The player character can travel between areas and
                    explore various paths at will, although prerequisites must be met to unlock certain areas.
                    The Dark Souls Trilogy began with the release of Dark Souls in October 2011 worldwide for the
                    PlayStation
                    and Xbox consoles. The PC version was released almost a year later in August 2012.
                    The great success achieved in his first game gave rise to his second installment called Dark Souls
                    II,
                    which was released worldwide in March 2014, with great acceptance by the players when they saw the
                    new
                    mechanics that it included.
                    To culminate his latest installment of the trilogy called Dark Souls III which was released
                    worldwide in
                    April 2016, FromSoftware implemented a much better image quality than its previous games, as well as
                    an
                    improved combat system and a lot of other qualities that they made this one of the best games to
                    date.
                    The Dark Souls trilogy was awarded multiple times for its innovative gameplay as well as its
                    incredible
                    high difficulty.
                    All Dark Souls Trilogy won Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Dark Souls focuses on dungeon exploring and the tension and fear that arise when players encounter
                    enemies in
                    this setting. The player character's interaction with the world of Dark Souls includes a great deal
                    of
                    combat. Combat includes melee attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical
                    abilities. For
                    melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide range of medieval-style weaponryâ€”including
                    swords,
                    spears, maces, magical swords, huge greatswords, and immense clubs. For defence, player characters
                    have
                    access to shields, armour, dodging, and parrying. For magic, which includes a wide variety of
                    offensive and
                    defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies. The player can learn these
                    different
                    skills through his journey through the world, either by buying them in stores that offer a wide
                    variety of
                    equipment, consumables and of course the skills already mentioned, or on the other hand by finding
                    them
                    around the world in the form of an object. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs,
                    variations, and
                    in-game costs associated with them. They can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through
                    levelling,
                    smithing, consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment. Souls are the universal currency of
                    the Dark
                    Souls trilogy. They are used to level up, buy items, upgrade/upgrade weapons, upgrade armor, and
                    repair
                    equipment. Souls are earned by slaying enemies, which is the best way to get them, the other way is
                    by
                    slaying bosses which give you a large amount of souls, or by consuming items that give you a set
                    number of
                    souls.</p>

                <h3>Bonfire</h3>
                <p>A Bonfire is a typical resting station in Dark Souls trilogy and a crucial gameplay element. Bonfires
                    are
                    located throughout the world and they are almost always safe enemy-free areas, although there are
                    exceptions. When a player rests at a bonfire, their health and stamina refill, along with their
                    spells and
                    Estus Flask, and all negative effects on the player (bleed, poison and toxic) are removed except
                    Curse.
                    Players may not rest at a bonfire if there are enemies nearby. From the bonfire, a player can
                    perform many
                    tasks.
                    Upon losing all of their health points and dying, players lose their Souls and are teleported back
                    to a
                    bonfire where they last rested, which serves as a checkpoint. One chance is given for the player to
                    recover
                    their lost Souls in the form of a bloodstain, which is placed at or around where they last died. If
                    the
                    player dies again before reaching their bloodstain, the Souls are permanently gone. As most enemies
                    are
                    respawned following player death, or if the player rest at a bonfire, the player has the opportunity
                    to
                    regain more Souls by repeated combat encounters. The bonfire is a type of campfire in the action
                    role-playing game Dark Souls and its sequels, that functions as a checkpoint for the player
                    character's
                    progress, as well as reviving most enemies that the player previously killed. Later in the game, and
                    in Dark
                    Souls II and III, they function as warp points.</p>

                <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
                <p>Online interaction in the Souls games is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout
                    levels,
                    players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden
                    passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that
                    when
                    activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and
                    potentially
                    helping the player avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the ground that can
                    either
                    help other players by providing hints and warnings or harm them by leaving false hints. Players can
                    also
                    engage in both player versus player combat (PVP) and cooperative gameplay using invasion or
                    summoning
                    mechanics.
                    The PVP experience varies depending on what is chosen, on the one hand we have a section of the game
                    in
                    which we can choose to enter the PVP, which will match us against another player with a similar
                    level and we
                    will battle to see who is the best. On the other hand we have the terror of the players, since there
                    is a
                    mechanism that allows players to invade other players' worlds, this means that if you are traveling
                    around
                    the world enjoying the game, it is possible that another player invades you and attack, this is
                    known as
                    invading; And the only way to make the other player go away is to kill him or get killed. All this
                    in real
                    time, which makes the battles more exciting.
                    Cooperative mode lets two players connect simultaneously to help each other to pass a zone or beat a
                    boss.
                    This allows you to connect with a friend through a password or connect with a stranger through an
                    item that
                    leaves a help signal on the ground, which other players can see and use if they choose to help you.
